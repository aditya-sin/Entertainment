# Entertainment
This project creates a static webpage containing a list of movies. It displays the **_posters_** and **_names_** of the movies and also shows there **_trailers_**. 

### What it contains
There are python, html and css files in the project. The Html file is created by `fresh_tomatoes.py` provided by Udacity and modified by me. `media.py` creates a class `Movie()`, while instances of this class are created by `entertainment_py.py`. Details of the movies are passed as arguments of the instances.

### How it works
User need to double-click `entertainment.py` which will open a local server in the brwoser displaying 9 movies. Users can also watch trailer of the movies by clicking on the particular movie poster. Modals showing trailers will close by either clicking on the close button or clicking anywhere outside the modal.
